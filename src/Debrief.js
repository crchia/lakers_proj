        for possessions directly terminated by a Jon Smith drive/post-up</li>
        <li style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Note 1: Smith's creation/efficiency in the playoffs was unbelievable, <br/>
        an indicator that he isn't vulnerable to playoff schemes/defenses.</li>
        <li style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Note 2: Smith not only prefers driving left as opposed to right, <br/>
        but the points generated off of his left drives is also significantly higher. </li>
        <li style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Note 2.5: The same left vs right preference can be applied to Smith's <br/>
        post-ups. Efficiency rises dramatically on left-side-of court post-ups</li>
        <li style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Conclusion: Smith is more than capable of carrying a high offensive load <br/>
        in the playoffs, a particularly valuable trait. <br/>
        Smith clearly has specific hot spots, and letting him create from these spots <br/>
        yields significantly increased team production.</li>
